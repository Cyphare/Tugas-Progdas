Validity of Statements:

a. student.course.callNum = "CSC230";
Invalid
Reason: callNum is of type int, but you're trying to assign a string to it, which will result in a type mismatch.

b. cin >> student.name;
Invalid
Reason: name is a structure of type nameType, and cin cannot be used directly for a struct. You would need to access individual members like cin >> student.name.first >> student.name.last.

c. classList[0] = name;
Invalid
Reason: classList[0] is of type studentType, but name is of type nameType. These types are not compatible, so this assignment is invalid.

d. classList[1].gpa = 3.45;
Valid
Reason: The gpa field exists in studentType as a double, and assigning a double value is valid.

e. name = classList[15].name;
Valid
Reason: Both name and classList[15].name are of type nameType, so this assignment is valid.

f. student.name = name;
Valid
Reason: Both student.name and name are of type nameType, so this assignment is valid.

g. cout << classList[10] << endl;
Invalid
Reason: You cannot output an entire struct directly to cout. You need to access individual members of classList[10].

h. for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) classList[j].name = name;
Valid
Reason: Each element in classList is of type studentType, and name is of type nameType. Assigning the nameType object to the name field is valid.

i. classList.course.credits = 3;
Invalid
Reason: The classList array contains studentType objects, which have a course field, but the correct syntax would be classList[i].course.credits to access the credits field for a specific student.

j. course = studentType.course;
Invalid
Reason: The correct way would be to access studentType via an instance like course = student.course.
